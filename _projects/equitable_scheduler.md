With the bloom of machine learning, academia starts exploring its application on resource managment. This project studies if ml-power scheduler does produce equitable decision? and how to mitigate or avoid possible inequality in web applicationâ€™s scheduling systems due to use of algorithmic models to determine task priority?

This project is currently being actively worked on. Details are confidential until completion.
