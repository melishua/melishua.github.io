<a href="https://example.com/datacenter">18-847 Datacenter Computing</a>, advised by: Prof. Akshitha Sriraman, and mentored by: Sara Mahdizadeh Shahri.

I was co-leading a research course project that is exploring potential inequity in modern computer systems, particularly centering around resource management in datacenters.

With the bloom of machine learning, academia starts exploring its application on resource managment. This project studies if ml-power scheduler does produce equitable decision? and how to mitigate or avoid possible inequality in web applicationâ€™s scheduling systems due to use of algorithmic models to determine task priority?

The goal of my research is to provide an insight into ML-based resource management system with primary objective on effcient resource utilization, or other conventionally common system optimization objectives, and evaluate if inequality exists in the decisions. Here, I proposed to model demographic specific requests reminasing user traits using classical mathmatical equations to assess if the system is biased against one trait versus another.

The result of this work is to demonstrate that implicit bias exists in our current system towards underserved communities, and us as system researcher, should be mindful of such problem when designing the resource management system.

Please feel free to contact me if you are interested to discuss this project furthur!
