CMU, STARLab, Advised by: Prof. <a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~asrirama/">Akshitha Sriraman</a> and Prof. <a href="https://ugupta.com/">Udit Gupta</a>

Iâ€™m currently co-leading a research project with <a href="https://jaylenwang7.github.io/">Jaylen Wang</a> to reduce the environmental impact of datacenters, particularly centering around reducing the embodied emissions of hardware used in datacenters/hyperscale systems with software solutions.
