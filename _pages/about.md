Hello there! nice to meet you and welcome to my page. I am a software engineer, a master student at Carnegie Mellon University, and a curious human being. I have been always inspired by ideas coming from different subjects. And I hope to apply my knowledge in software engineering to challenges in various fields. 

I am interested in **machine learning systems**, **distributed systems**, and **hyper-scale computing**.

I love to understand how our universe works and I believe that we are in the process of developing such tool that would help us better understand the truth of this universe.

Solving puzzles is one of my favourite activities throughout my life. I love finding answers to unknowns and possibilities to the world.
