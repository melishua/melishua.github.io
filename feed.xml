And I am very happy for myself for doing what I did.</p> <p>I achieved two childhood dreams. I crossed a few things off from my bucket/todo list. I picked up a new hobby. I attended a lot of fun activities for the first time. I visited a couple places for the first time as well. I met a lot of new friends and interesting minds. I recieved a lot of love and support from people around me. And I set up one(or two) new goal for the next 10 years.</p> <p><strong>Jan-May.</strong> Going back to school after few years of working felt very special. I personally really enjoy this period of time, where I have no other priorities in mind other than: I want to learn as much as possible. I felt really fulfilled, energized and confident. It was definitely a very different student experience than my undergraduate years. I have to say both are wonderful experiences and I cherish both, but it is simply very different in terms of dynamics, focuses, and campus. And that was went I finally understand what Mr. X suggested in his podcast that he encourage his children to go to have education experience at two different uniserities with one being in a metropolitan city where a lot of things are going on, and also a one being in a place that’s more calming.</p> <p><strong>May-Aug.</strong> Internship at Google was also one of a “life-changing” experience. Hearing about all Bay Area stories and actually being there is very different. Everyone you meet are super talented, brilliant, and is working hard towards their goals. A goal I set for myself was to try coffee chat with as many people as possible, which I did. It was very inspiring to hear about the thoughts and perspective from people who are your peer, to people who are a few year ahead of you in their life stage, to people who are more senior. I definitely gain new perspective towards the tech industry as a whole.</p> <p><strong>Aug-Dec.</strong> Coming back to school this time, I have a clear goal in mind. It is always special when you are working hard towards your dream. But this time I wasn’t all alone, I was very fortunate to get all the support from people around me from members of the lab and from my friends, which makes me very appreciative of everything I have and of my current life.</p> <p>My friend also took me to climbing for the first time at the Pittsburgh ascend climbing gym. I instantly fall in love with this sport, climbed for 3 hours straight…. even tho I got my arm scratched, but I went again a few days after. I love how climbing has this puzzle solving piece in it from route reading and understanding your own strengths and limits. I also like how this sport is friendly for people with different physical strengths, and contains this social aspect to it. And I am making climbing my regular acitivty now.</p> <p>Another theme this year is that I met a lot of genuine people with interesting minds, who became great friends and mentors. I learned to open up myself more and not afraid to be vulnerable – even my MBTI score for E(xtrovert) went up a bit haha. Joke aside, before CMU, I was told by a mentorly figure that - going to a new environment with no families and known friends will be perfect for a transformative self-discovery journey, where I will be lonely and sad sometime but definitely worth. I think he was right, for most part of it, except for the lonely and sad part :)</p> <p>I also encountered a situation this year that I have never faced before. Despite me being confused and sad at the time being, I am proud of myself to handle it in the most professional and best possible way and learned a great life lesson. Beyond the situation itself, I think I gained more inner peace with myself. I am always a big fan of mindfulness talks, yet knowing the “philosophies” and feeling it personally gives you a whole next level of understanding.</p> <p>These motivational quotes/lines gave me a lot of energy, and sharing them here (by SodaBella)</p> <ol> <li>If I made up my mind, then I can do it. Think about “What if I did it?” instead of “What if I can’t do it?”.</li> <li>Believe that everything I do is to build a better version of myself. Don’t be afraid to try things that I haven’t done before or don’t know how to do -&gt; manage my fear (of failure) instead of getting control by it.</li> <li>Don’t be afraid of communication and sharing ideas. You will loose opportunities for growth and feedback.</li> <li>Focus on the actions.</li> <li>You don’t need everyone to understand you.</li> <li>Make the decision right, instead of trying to make the right decision.</li> <li>I deserve happiness and the life I want.</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="life,"/><category term="school,"/><category term="education,"/><category term="work"/><category term="life"/><category term="school"/><category term="education"/><category term="work"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[2023 End of Year Reflection]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Why Master after 3 years of work?</title><link href="https://melishua.github.io/blog/2023/why_master/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why Master after 3 years of work?"/><published>2023-08-01T15:59:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-08-01T15:59:00+00:00</updated><id>https://melishua.github.io/blog/2023/why_master</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://melishua.github.io/blog/2023/why_master/"><![CDATA[<p>“CS don’t need degree from education systems”, “Anyone can become a SDE if you know how to code”. These are common statements that I have heard over the years even back in Universities. While some people say it as a self-mocking joke, it seeds the question on value of higher educations for CS in (some) people’s mind. Thus, many of my undergraduate friends are suprised when I expressed my interests in grad school after having a job as SDE.</p> <p>This question continue to follow me when I started my masters’ study at Carnegie Mellon University, and during my internship at Google. I think one of the root cause of having this question comes from ones’ perception on the objective of grad school.</p> <p>One point of view that I hear a lot is: “People go to school to find a job, if you already have a job, why school?”. There’s nothing wrong with this point if and only if all ones want is A job. It is easy for most of us (including myself at some point) to draw equal signs between education and career. You can literally look at the job decription of your dream job and evaluate what kind of degree is required.</p> <p>But set aside the minimal requirements (in typical case, because there are exceptions for sure), being a SDE don’t really have a hard requirement beyond a bachelor degree in most cases. So what does a master degree in computer engineering, computer science or related field provides?</p> <p>I have personally met a few people who pursue a master degree because they want to pivot from their undergraduate major. But that wasn’t the case for me either. I studies computer engineering at the University of Toronto, and developed solid foundatoins in computer systems, network, algorithms &amp; data etc…</p> <p>What is the advantage of a cs master degree? there are “About 419,000,000 results” on Google. Some of the common ones are:</p> <ol> <li>higher pay</li> <li>advance subject knowledge</li> <li>job growth</li> <li>competitive candidacy</li> <li>senior roles</li> </ol> <p>from source: https://www.coursera.org/articles/is-a-masters-in-computer-science-worth-it#</p> <p>But personally, my biggest motivation is that I have unfinshed dreams from undergraduate studies that I want to complete. I rather be doing it now and knowing if I like it or dislike it when I am yonge, than being at my 50s and regretting not taking the chance to complete my dream. And luckly, I have been liking a lot.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="life,"/><category term="school,"/><category term="education"/><category term="life"/><category term="school"/><category term="education"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[this is one of the most frequently asked questions I got since I decided to pursue a master degree]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Game of Life</title><link href="https://melishua.github.io/blog/2019/the-game-of-life/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Game of Life"/><published>2019-12-07T15:59:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-12-07T15:59:00+00:00</updated><id>https://melishua.github.io/blog/2019/the-game-of-life</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://melishua.github.io/blog/2019/the-game-of-life/"><![CDATA[<p>APS444 (happy engineering - positive psychology) is one of the best courses that I have ever taken in my life. The experience and lessons are truly life changing for me. I chose “inner peace” as the unit of building block for myself. And I’m glad that I discovered my inner peace.</p> <p>The following is a self-reflection journal I wrote after one of the class.</p> <p>Insights</p> <ul> <li>Play it is the feeling of enjoyment and the lost track of time when I am doing something interesting to me.</li> <li>Life will be fun if I consider everything as a game.</li> </ul> <p>Story “Oh my god!!! These were my favourite toys that I always wanted!!” I ran to the shelf that was full of barbie dolls and princess dresses as I entered Toys R’ US’. I leaned forward to look at a delicate holiday barbie set that could make a five-years-old me go crazy, and I continued my stroll. I didn’t feel anything wrong about this natural and “normal” behaviour. Why would I, a 22 years-old young adult, buy a barbie set? As I laughed to tell my team that I am not getting anything from the store, the my five-year-old’s dream was finally heard by the 22 year-old me - I want to have a barbie house when I grow up, I want to buy as many barbies as I want when I have financial freedom. When and how did my dream got lost in the interim of time? Why is my favourite toy no longer relevant to me?</p> <p>The doll was one of the most important toys in my childhood. My personality determined the play I had, or rather, my play shaped me and my character through time. When I was a kid, I was the shiest and most introverted girl in my class. I had no friends in kindergarten due to the language barrier. I used to only speak Cantonese, but I went to a Mandarin school. My happiest moment was to go home after school and start playing by myself. Roleplay with my dolls, read the children’s book or draw whimsically were my primary play activities at home. As much as my story may sound upsetting even for myself describing it now, I don’t think there is anything wrong with the way I was. My play formed a steady state of mind for me. Immersed in my own little world, I learned how to enjoy myself through coming up plot-lines with my dolls, I learned the principle virtues through reading the children’s literature, and I gained creativity through sketching everywhere.</p> <p>Yes, I may not remember my barbie dream now, but barbie is with me all the time with the self-enjoying and self-healing ability that she brought me. My childhood dream was not lost in the interim of time, my favourite toy is not unimportant to me, they just transformed into little units in myself that I did not notice initially. A sunny Saturday afternoon, a pile of books on the sun-warmed floor, few barbie dolls placed align listening to the five-years-old me with my grandma’s glasses teaching them animals, this scene may be left behind 15 years ago, but I took away the best gift from my childhood playtime – how to enjoy myself.</p> <p>Now, I learn the new definition of play. It is not associated with a toy or any objects, it is the feeling of enjoyment and the lost track of time when I am doing something interesting to me. Play is not barbie, play is not children’s book, play is not crayon set, play is the moment that I enjoyed my time with them. If I were to be asked what I, as a 22-years-old young adult, play now? I would probably answer scrolling through Instagram on my phone or watching YouTube on my laptop. But if I am asked for this question now again, with the new definition, there is so much more that I can add on my play list. I am roleplaying a real-life mentor by inspiring my cousin who is interested in STEM for girls, I am reading research publications that expand my knowledge, I am drawing system-diagrams for my capstone project. They share the same principle as my childhood playtime, but I never considered them as play before. Imagine how happy I could be every day if finding bugs in my codes is a treasure hunt game and going to lecture is watching the game tutorial.</p> <p>As a fourth-year student, I am approaching to the end of a game called – undergraduate life. I have had tears due to the time that I did not play out the game well, but I carried through firmly with the foundations I built. I have had laughers from completing the challenges successfully, which I can add these experience perks to my future game strategies. I am about to start the next level of the game soon – graduate study or industrial life. It can be scary for not knowing what to expect, but I am sure that I will be able to complete each stage of challenges and find enjoyment in life, with my definition of play, with the barbies in myself, and with my inner peace of mind.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="life"/><category term="life"/><category term="self-reflection"/><category term="inner-peace"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Self-reflection on what does toy means for me in life?]]></summary></entry></feed>
