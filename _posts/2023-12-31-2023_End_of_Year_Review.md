If I have to use one word to describe 2023, it would be: **adventurous**.

Reflecting back, I would never imaged this journey one years ago. And I am very happy for myself for doing what I did.

I achieved two childhood dreams. I crossed a few things off from my bucket/todo list. I picked up a new hobby. I attended a lot of fun activities for the first time. I visited a couple places for the first time as well. I met a lot of new friends and interesting minds. I recieved a lot of love and support from people around me. And I set up one(or two) new goal for the next 10 years. 

**Jan-May.** Going back to school after few years of working felt very special. I personally really enjoy this period of time, where I have no other priorities in mind other than: I want to learn as much as possible. I felt really fulfilled, energized and confident. It was definitely a very different student experience than my undergraduate years. I have to say both are wonderful experiences and I cherish both, but it is simply very different in terms of dynamics, focuses, and campus. And that was went I finally understand what Mr. X suggested in his podcast that he encourage his children to go to have education experience at two different uniserities with one being in a metropolitan city where a lot of things are going on, and also a one being in a place that's more calming.


**May-Aug.**
Internship at Google was also one of a "life-changing" experience. Hearing about all Bay Area stories and actually being there is very different. Everyone you meet are super talented, brilliant, and is working hard towards their goals. A goal I set for myself was to try coffee chat with as many people as possible, which I did. It was very inspiring to hear about the thoughts and perspective from people who are your peer, to people who are a few year ahead of you in their life stage, to people who are more senior. I definitely gain new perspective towards the tech industry as a whole.

**Aug-Dec.**
Coming back to school this time, I have a clear goal in mind. It is always special when you are working hard towards your dream. But this time I wasn't all alone, I was very fortunate to get all the support from people around me from members of the lab and from my friends, which makes me very appreciative of everything I have and of my current life. 

My friend also took me to climbing for the first time at the Pittsburgh ascend climbing gym. I instantly fall in love with this sport, climbed for 3 hours straight.... even tho I got my arm scratched, but I went again a few days after. I love how climbing has this puzzle solving piece in it from route reading and understanding your own strengths and limits. I also like how this sport is friendly for people with different physical strengths, and contains this social aspect to it. And I am making climbing my regular acitivty now.

Another theme this year is that I met a lot of genuine people with interesting minds, who became great friends and mentors. I learned to open up myself more and not afraid to be vulnerable -- even my MBTI score for E(xtrovert) went up a bit haha. Joke aside, before CMU, I was told by a mentorly figure that - going to a new environment with no families and known friends will be perfect for a transformative self-discovery journey, where I will be lonely and sad sometime but definitely worth. I think he was right, for most part of it, except for the lonely and sad part :)

I also encountered a situation this year that I have never faced before. Despite me being confused and sad at the time being, I am proud of myself to handle it in the most professional and best possible way and learned a great life lesson. Beyond the situation itself, I think I gained more inner peace with myself. I am always a big fan of mindfulness talks, yet knowing the "philosophies" and feeling it personally gives you a whole next level of understanding. 

These motivational quotes/lines gave me a lot of energy, and sharing them here (by SodaBella)
1. If I made up my mind, then I can do it. Think about "What if I did it?" instead of "What if I can't do it?".
2. Believe that everything I do is to build a better version of myself. Don't be afraid to try things that I haven't done before or don't know how to do -> manage my fear (of failure) instead of getting control by it. 
3. Don't be afraid of communication and sharing ideas. You will loose opportunities for growth and feedback.
4. Focus on the actions.
5. You don't need everyone to understand you.
6. Make the decision right, instead of trying to make the right decision.
7. I deserve happiness and the life I want.
