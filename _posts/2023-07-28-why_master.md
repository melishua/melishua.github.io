"CS don't need degree from education systems", "Anyone can become a SDE if you know how to code". These are common statements that I have heard over the years even back in Universities. While some people say it as a self-mocking joke, it seeds the question on value of higher educations for CS in (some) people's mind. Thus, many of my undergraduate friends are suprised when I expressed my interests in grad school after having a job as SDE.

This question continue to follow me when I started my masters' study at Carnegie Mellon University, and during my internship at Google. I think one of the root cause of having this question comes from ones' perception on the objective of grad school.

One point of view that I hear a lot is: "People go to school to find a job, if you already have a job, why school?". There's nothing wrong with this point if and only if all ones want is A job. It is easy for most of us (including myself at some point) to draw equal signs between education and career. You can literally look at the job decription of your dream job and evaluate what kind of degree is required.

But set aside the minimal requirements (in typical case, because there are exceptions for sure), being a SDE don't really have a hard requirement beyond a bachelor degree in most cases. So what does a master degree in computer engineering, computer science or related field provides?

I have personally met a few people who pursue a master degree because they want to pivot from their undergraduate major. But that wasn't the case for me either. I studies computer engineering at the University of Toronto, and developed solid foundatoins in computer systems, network, algorithms & data etc...

What is the advantage of a cs master degree? there are "About 419,000,000 results" on Google. Some of the common ones are:
1. higher pay
2. advance subject knowledge
3. job growth
4. competitive candidacy
5. senior roles

But personally, my biggest motivation is that I have unfinshed dreams from undergraduate studies that I want to complete. I rather be doing it now and knowing if I like it or dislike it when I am yonge, than being at my 50s and regretting not taking the chance to complete my dream. And luckly, I have been liking a lot.
