"CS don't need degree from education systems", "Anyone can become a SDE if you know how to code". These are common statements that I have heard over the years even back in Universities. While some people say it as a self-mocking joke, it seeds the question on value of higher educations for CS in (some) people's mind. Thus, many of my undergraduate friends are suprised when I expressed my interests in grad school after having a job as SDE.

This question continue to follow me when I started my masters' study at Carnegie Mellon University, and during my internship at Google. I think one of the root cause of having this question comes from ones' perception on the objective of grad school.
